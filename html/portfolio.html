                <h4>Sentiment Analysis</h4>
                <p>The intent of this natural language processing problem was to predict the ratings of a movie-goer based on his/her review. In order to yield the most accurate results, I explored combinations of various pre-processing techniques on a training data set. Approaches include lemmatizing, stemming, removing stopwords, observing word frequency and inverse document frequency. With the feature matrix engineered, I trained models using logistic regression, a support vector machine of a linear kernel, and a naive bayes and used the most accurate models on a test set.</p>

This project focused on producing images that highly resembled famous drawings. By mutating a population of images consisting of polygons and selecting for the best fit children, I was able to evolve the population to a desired target. </p>

Because a linear planner is inefficient in determining a solution for (this type of problem category), I used a nonlinear partial order planner. Initially I began with empty partial plans. I then continuously added causal links, which connect states, until a partial plan has met all conditions and is considered complete.</p>

The expected utility for each action at any given position is calculated. The action with the greatest expected utility is used as the optimal policy for that position and is used to update the policy for that position (along with value at position). Policies were are updated until convergence. Monte Carlo simulations were run to verify the model’s acceptability.</p>

                <h4>A* Search Algorithm</h4>
                <p>The classic traveling salesman problem is an NP-hard problem that requires(?) the shortest route to connect a set of points. I used the A* search algorithm because it is an admissible heuristic. Several heuristics were explored to help efficiently determine the optimal path. For estimating the cost of the remaining (sparse graph) path, Kruskal’s algorithm was found most useful. A mininum spanning tree was created and the heuristic allowed for pruning of excessive length paths.</p>

                <p>Given a library of articles, I was able to attribute an author to anonymous works. To ignore the bias of the article content and focus on a writer’s patterns, I used stopword frequency as a measurement. Stop word frequency was a much better predictor of authorship over term frequency.</p>

The five stage pipeline was complete with data forwarding and branch prediction, to prevent data hazards and control flow hazards. By allowing for the register files and memory writes to be present for the entire cycle, forwarding can be used to update instruction dependencies.</p>
